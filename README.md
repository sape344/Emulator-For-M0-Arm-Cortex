#Definition of Emulator
On the computer, an emulator is hardware or software that allows a computer system (called a host computer) to act like another computer system (called a guest). An emulator typically allows the host system to run software designed for the guest system or use peripheral devices. Emulation refers to the ability of a computer program in an electronic device to emulate (or imitate) another program or device. Emulator works like an interpreter. Emulator translates what it receives codes into another code language in which the machine operates.

#Process of Writing Emulator
First of all, we took over all sources, which given by instructor. We tried to understand what we do, or how we do. We had an OR example. Thanks to this instruction, we wrote other instructions as well. Firstly, according to “ARM-Thumb-instruction-encodings.pdf”, we wrote all op code of instructions. In order to understand what we should do, we checked “CortexM0_QuickReferenceGuide.pdf” and “CortexM0_Generic_User_Guide.pdf”. The best hard part of writing emulator is error correction. We just have looked to find error for 3 days. Then we realized that we wrote a word incorrectly. Then we set it then finally our code work. you can see that screen figures changing at below figures.
